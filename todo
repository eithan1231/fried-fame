Things of utmost importance:
DONE 1) Support
  1.1) Support channels (General help, payment problem, something else?)
  1.2) WYSIWYG Editor for responses (can be im)
  1.2) On response, push email notifications.
NOPE 2) Control client via website through socket communications.
3) Script Templating (for automatic deploying)
4) System-wide monitor
 4.1) Monitor VPN nodes.
 4.2) Monitor requests, etc.
 4.3) If node has above xx connections at any given time, create a new node in same geo location.
 4.4) Throttling.
DONE 5) Caching
  5.1) Configuration cache.
    5.1.1) Store it in a file (still slow to read from)
    5.1.2) Port it to a php file, so we can opcache it.
  5.2) General cache
NOPE 6) Automatic bad email revert on email change. If user changes email, supplies
  invalid email, this will revert it to old one.
DONE 7) Server-Node Health
8) Subscriptions
	8.1) Manage payments.
		ii) Ability to implement other payment gateways with ease
	8.2) Manage Subscription plans
9) Administration Panel


Things that are of medium importance:
1) Referral system.
2) Client API.
3) Pre-order.
4) Template CSS files. This will allow for us to change theme color and stuff.



Things that will be good to have, but aren't of the very most importance.
1) Link with MPGH account.
2) Plugin support
  2.1) Go through, and make hooks for most functions
  2.2) Make a plugin interface.
  2.3) Make a file to register plugins.
3) Refactor, project structure change, general cleanup.
4) In the future, assuming we need to scale the web servers outwards, we need
  to synchronize files throughout them. So make something that will automatically
  sync files throughout multiple servers, then push a command to purge op-cache.
